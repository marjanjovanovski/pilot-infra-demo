	<p>Two and a half decades ago I was given a chance in IT. Reflecting back I can highlight few of my contributions made to global road safety, patient care and social connections.</p>
	<p class="side_note">
		Fair warning ~ 330 words of personal intro ahead.
	</p>
	<p>
		My involvement in IT begins with print design, as a necessity to assist my father’s <span class="tone_mid">craftsmanship</span>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PirografijaVancho" target="_blank">pyrography</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Several years later in 2002-03 my very first HTML page was created to showcase <a href="https://www.bowerswilkins.com/" target="_blank">Bowers & Wilkins</a>’ flagship model, the “Nautilus”—it was developed so I could approach a local speaker reseller for a website idea. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2006 I designed, developed, led and shipped a complex custom build CMS for Johnson Controls (multiple roles, at that time considered as one).
	</p>
	<p>
		In the upcoming two decades I had the chance to design many products in healthcare, automotive, big power…lead various teams, shipped, optimize redundancy, recognize and create patterns, document and make assessments. Delivered projects for Renault, Honda, Samsung, Johnson Controls, Lufthansa, various governmental work sponsored by UK, Singapore and several Balkan Peninsula governments. Have serviced for many years in Project Management, Product Design and Quality (CMMI). On some occasions I might even come across as a <span class="tone_mid">generalist</span>.

		A bit about myself...
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		I’m a father of two and try to stay healthy by a disciplined workout routine (home workouts yoga and functional training).
	
		I like to build, both in the digital and the analog world. Love tools and what they stand for — empowering one to bring a vision into existence. Open to learn and evolve.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’m not a self-made man. I owe the fundaments and many functions I utilize to my father, Vancho Jovanovski. After thirty years it dawned on me “why I was his little shadow as a kid”. He was just the right kind of person for me: honest, a limit pusher, never cutting corners, he almost always exceed my expectations. He taught me to lead by example, simply by just doing that. I like to say: “He owns two-right hands”.
